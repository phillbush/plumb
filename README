NAME
     plumb – run command on arguments matching rules

SYNOPSIS
     plumb [-eon] [-a actions] [-c config] arg ...

DESCRIPTION
     plumb pass the given arguments, as is or modified, to the best program
     associated to the rules the arguments match with.

     plumb can be used, for example, to open files or URLs.  By giving
     filenames as arguments, plumb tries to find the best program to open them
     after matching the filenames with sets of rules in sequence.  See the
     section EXAMPLES for an example on usage.

     Each set of rule (or ruleset) is associated with a program for a given
     type of action (such as "open" or "edit").  The program for the given
     action associated with the first ruleset matching the arguments is the
     one chosen to be run.

     The options are as follows:

     -a actions
             Comma-delimited list of actions to be try.  If the matching rule
             contains one of those actions, the first action in the matching
             rule is performed.  For example, -a edit,open will try to perform
             either the edit or the open action on the given arguments.

     -c config
             Use the file config rather than ~/lib/plumb as the file
             containing plumbing rules.

     -e      The action is to "edit".  This is the same as the option -a edit.

     -o      The action is to "open".  This is the same as the option -a open.
             This is the default action.

     -n      Dry-run.  When this option is given, plumb does not executes the
             matched program, but prints what would be executed to standard
             output.

     Invoking plumb as "open" (that is, with the basename of its argv[0] equal
     to "open") is equivalent to using the -o option.  Invoking plumb as
     "edit" is equivalent to using the -e option.

USAGE
     plumb reads rules from the file $HOME/lib/plumb or from the file
     specified by the -c command-line option.  Lines with blank and lines
     beginning with "# are ignored."

     Each non ignored line can be either a static variable assignment or can
     be one of the four following types, named after the second word in the
     line:

     "for"   A line beginning a ruleset.

     "matches"
             A line describing a condition a variable has to match case-
             sensitively, and, optionally, setting new variables when the
             matching occurs.

     "imatches"
             A line describing a condition a variable has to match case-
             insensitively, and, optionally, setting new variables when the
             matching occurs.

     "types"
             A line testing the existence and type of a file, and assigning
             this information to a new variable.

     "with"  A line describing the command to be open if the conditions in the
             same ruleset matches.

     There are two kinds of variables that can be assigned and used in the
     configuration file:

     Static variables
             Static variables are assigned with a "NAME=VALUE" line.  Such
             variables are expanded into a single word when prefixed with a
             dollar sign ($) and occurring in any line after the place it was
             defined.  Environment variables are of this kind, but do not need
             to be defined.  See the section Static variables for more
             information on static variables.

     Argument variables
             Argument variables are assigned with a "matches", "imatches", or
             a "types" line.  Such variables can be expanded into various
             words (one for each argument passed to plumb) when prefixed with
             a percent sign (%) and occurring as the last argument of a "with"
             line in the same ruleset it was defined.  See the section WITH-
             lines for more information on argument variables.

     Each line is a sequence of words (which are either space-delimited words
     or strings quoted in rc(1) single-quote style).  The first word of a line
     is the "subject".  The second word (which identifies the type of the
     line) is the "verb".  The remaining words are the arguments.

     The configuration is processed once for each argument.  For each
     processing pass, the argument variable data is set to the argument itself
     and the remaining argument variables are re-assigned.  Static variables
     are assigned only once, at plumb initialization.

   Static variables
     Lines of the form "NAME=VALUE" assign a value to a static variable.
     Static variable are recognized anywhere in the file after the place they
     are defined.

     Environment variables are also static variables, but they are not defined
     in the config file (they are already defined in the environment).

     References to static variables can occur on the configuration file
     outside quotations, and are replaced with their values.  Such references
     are prefixed with the dollar sign "$" or prefixed with the dollar sign
     and surrounded by curly braces.  The dollar sign can be escaped by
     doubling it.

   FOR-lines
     Lines whose second word is "for" must have "rules" as subject.  They
     begin a new ruleset.  A ruleset is everything between a "FOR-line" and
     the next one.

     For example, the following line begins the ruleset for handling video
     files:

           rules for video files

     The arguments of a "FOR-line" are the name of the ruleset.  When a
     ruleset is matched for all the arguments, its name is printed to standard
     output.

     Conditions in a ruleset are only checked within the ruleset.  Variables
     set in a ruleset are only valid within the ruleset.

     The lines before the first "FOR-line" make the global, unamed ruleset.
     Conditions in the global ruleset are ignored.  Variables set in the
     global ruleset are valid for the entire file.

   MATCHES-lines
     Lines whose second word is "matches" or "imatches" must have the name of
     a variable as subject (first word in the line).  They must also have a
     regular expression as first argument.  The subject names a value that
     must match the regular expression.

     If the second word is "matches", the regular expression matching is case-
     sensitive.  If the second word is "imatches", the regular expression
     matching is case-insensitive.

     For example, the following line is a three-word condition that says that
     one of the conditions for the current ruleset to be matched is for the
     content of the variable mime to match the regular expression
     image/(jpeg|png).

           mime matches 'image/(jpeg|png)'

     The regular expression is a extended POSIX regular expression and must
     match the entire value of the argument variable for the condition to be
     valid.

     If the rule has more than one argument, the second argument must be into
     and the following ones must be names of argument variables to be set.
     Each argument variable is set to the substring matching the parenthesized
     subexpression of the regular expression if, and only if, the full regular
     expression matches the value of the subject.

     For example, the following line assigns to the argument variable base the
     basename(1) of the value on the argument variable data (supposing it
     contains a filename); and assigns to the argument variable extension the
     extension of the filename.  If either subexpression does not match, the
     corresponding argument variable is set to the empty string.  The dummy
     argument variable name _ (underscore) is used for uneeded values.

           data matches '(([^/]*/)*)([^/]*(\.([A-Za-z0-9]+)?))' _ _ base extension

   TYPES-lines
     Lines whose second word is "types" must have the name of a argument
     variable as subject, and the name of another argument variable as single
     argument.  The subject names a value for a existing file whose mimetype
     is assigned to the argument variable passed as argument.

     For example, the following line is a three-word assignment that says that
     the mimetype of the file named in the argument variable data must be
     assigned to the argument variable mime.

           data types mime

   WITH-lines
     Lines whose second word is "with" must have the name of an action type
     (like open or edit) as subject and a command invocation as arguments.
     The arguments name a program to be run for the action named as subject
     when the ruleset the line is in is valid for all the arguments passed.

     for example, the following line is a three-word description to open the
     browser firefox(1) on the open action.

           open with firefox

     If the last argument has a percent symbol ("%") before a name, then this
     name is considered as a variable name.  This argument is replaced by one
     argument for each argument passed and the variable name with the percent
     sign is replaced with the value of the variable.

     For example, the following line opens firefox(1) replacing the argument
     file://%data for the variable data for each argument.  (so if plumb is
     invoked for ./index.html and /path/to/file.html, then that single
     argument is replaced with file://./index.html and
     file:///path/to/file.html).

           open with firefox -- file://%data

     Just like environment variables, the percent sign can be escaped by
     doubling it.  The name of the variable can also occur between curly
     braces.

ENVIRONMENT
     The following environment variables affect the execution of plumb.

     HOME    Path to the directory to search for the file lib/plumb.  Unless
             the -c command-line option is used, it is an error for this
             variable to not be set.

FILES
     $HOME/lib/plumb
             plumb's default configuration file.

EXIT STATUS
     The plumb utility exits 0 on success, and >0 if an error occurs.

     It is an error if no ruleset matches for an argument.

EXAMPLES
     The following is the example of a simple configuration file.

           HTTP      = '(https?)'
           DATAREGEX = '(([A-Za-z]+):(//)?)?(.*(\.([A-Za-z0-9]+))?)'

           data     matches     $DATAREGEX into _ protocol _ file _ extension
           file     types       mime

           rules    for         youtube video
           protocol matches     '(ytdl|'$HTTP')?'
           file     matches     '(.*/)?[A-Za-z0-9_-]{11}'
           open     with        mpv --force-window=immediate -- %data

           rules    for         html file
           protocol matches     '(file)?'
           mime     matches     'text/html'
           open     with        seamonkey -- file://%file
           edit     with        $TERMCMD -e $EDITOR -- %file

           rules    for          web page
           protocol matches     ${HTTP}?
           file     matches     '(www\.)?.*\.(com|net|org|us)'
           open     with        seamonkey -- %data

     The static variables HTTP and DATAREGEX are set to regular expressions to
     be used later in the config file.

     For each passed argument, the second paragraph sets the argument
     variables "protocol" to an URI protocol; "file" to the argument without
     the protocol; "extension" to a file extension; and "mime" to the mimetype
     of the value of "file".  The argument variable "data" is automatically
     set to the argument itself on each pass.

     The third paragraph sets rules for opening youtube videos on mpv(1) using
     the ytdl protocol.

     The fourth paragraph sets rules for opening and editing html files.

     The fifth paragraph sets rules for opening web pages.
